### Mapview Project
- When the Mapview app is opened, it asks for location permission. it brings up a warning message on the screen if permission is denied or restricted permission is granted
- This alert contains two options : cancel and go to settings
- Marking a point on the map and clicking the draw route button draws the main route and alternative routes
- You can switch between alternative routes with the arrow keys.

### Scrollview Project
- When the application is opened, it switches between color screens every 10 seconds
